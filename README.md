Hi! I'm José María Jiménez-Coronado, but you can call me Chema.
I'm an Electronics Engineer graduated from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology and devoted to space and plasma science.

Currently I'm working as a DSP Engineer in the R&D department of an RF communications company based in the US, where I'm in
charge of tasks regarding FPGA, embedded systems, radiofrequency and DSP.
